         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Can that be unlawfull which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the defence of the King? to whom ſhould the military ſtrength of the Kingdome be ſubject if not to the King.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I allow all this, and my deſire as well as yours is, to ſacrifice my bloud in maintaining the Kings right, againſt all ſuch as would have him invade the priviledges of the Subject, and ſuch as ſeek the diſſolution of the Parliament. In a word, I ſtand for the King and the Parliament, you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the King as he is carried away by the evill counſell of Malignants.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe Malignants indeed have been ſufficiently railed upon, and under that title have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124665:3"/>been compriſed many well affected Subjects; for if every one led only a loyall ſubjection, did but afar off appeare to encline to the Kings deſignes, he was branded with the marke of a malignant ſpirit, ſo that many have by vulgar opinion been undeſervedly included under that appellation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>Though I know Array, that you are a thing created by Regall Authority, and doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to affront the Militia, I will ſhew you your firſt beginning and originall, which we ſpread a bluſh upon your cheeke, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if you have any grace or Religion, while in a briefe Narration I doe give you an account of your owne Pedigree, for you are an upſtart peece of the military ſtrength of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>Tis falſe, I can derive my antiquity from the raignes of many former Kings, wherein I have done very good ſervice, and ſuch hath my valour been, that I have in many Battels cruſhed the inſolent Commons, and brought a glorious victory to the Kings Standard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>You brag on wrong grounds. It is the end of any action that doth merit honour, your confiding in doing ſervice for the King in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Parliament, is an argument built on falſe grounds; but you are conformable in your words to your purpoſes and beginning: For when the King through the inſtigation of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124665:3"/>malignant party conſiſting of Papiſts, prelaticall Clergy, Delinquents, and part of the Nobility and Gentry, who ſerving the Court, had combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bury the happineſſe of this Kingdome in the ruine of this Parliament, and to cut up the freedome of Parliaments by the root, and to erect in this Kingdome an arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then you the Commiſsion of Array were preſently thought upon, and away you were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into ſeverall Countries by divers Noblemen, there by an illegall power to raiſe an Army for the protection of Delinquents from the hands of Iuſtice, firſt under colour of a Guard for the King, you and your Commiſsion of Array over-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeverall Counties, compelling the Trained Bands by force to come in and joyne with you, or diſarming them and putting their Armes into the hands of lewde and deſperate perſons, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by turned the Armes of the Kingdome againſt it ſelfe, and this was your intention.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>I had no ſuch purpoſe but was for the ſafety of the kingdome, and the honour of the King: For it was alwayes thought fit and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the King ſhould have the ordering and diſpoſing of the Militia of the kingdome; but when you were ſetled and ordered by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament againſt the Kings deſire, and put into ſuch hands as they would confide in then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of Array iſſued out not to diſturbe the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124665:4"/>peace of the kingdome, but to defend it as well as you or any other Militia.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>How comes it then to paſſe, that when the deſigne which had bin ſo long carryed on to alter the frame and conſtitution of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in Church and State, was now come to ripeneſſe, and the conteiners thereof conceived themſelves arrived to that condition of ſtrength, that they ſhould be able to put it in preſent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they have now made the K. raiſe a great army, this was your doings, commiſsion of Aray.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>I was ſent abroad indeed to uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force I could to compell and ſummon them in, but more came in voluntarily then by vertue of my commiſsion; the Gentry and Cavaliers freely engaging themſelves in that ſervice, and ſuch a great confluence of ſeverall perſons floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto the King, that they needed no compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Horſe, Armes and Amunition being daily brought, and beſides the Royall Standard which had a glorious preſence in the field, drew more unto it then the commiſsion of Array.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>If you diſdaine the matter already, tis likely you knew that your power was illegall, ſtanding alwayes in defiance of the Parliament, and of the Militia, but I hope to make you know your errour in time. It is fit that Militia being a faithfull ſubject to the King and Parliament, and ſtanding for both againſt thoſe malignants,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124665:4"/>wherewith the King is now environed, ſhould be better eſteemed than nothing of yeſterday. I meane the commiſsion of Array.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>Tis falſe, and I will make, thee know thou malicious Militia, thou leader on of leatherne Coates and City Round-heads, that you are but a crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king noiſe to me, what doe boyes but waſte powder in the ſtreets? and ſo are you nothing but an invention to make away powder, carrying a faire ſhew of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed affection to your King and Countrey, but are led on by the inſtigation of weekly pay, and a love you beare to oppoſition, ſpeake no more, for Array is accounted with a ſword, which as I weare by my ſide, ſo I dare man age for my King and Countrey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>I regard not your ſword (Array) nor can your threatening language ſtrike a terrour into me, the goodneſſe of my deſigne in defending the King and Parliament, doth give me boldneſſe to appeare in the field againſt you and your ſwaggering Troops of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, who having engaged themſelves againſt their Countrey, would now upon cooler bloud be glad with ſafety to retire. I muſt tell you that the name of Array is odious to the people, and therefore your beſt refuge is the countrey, for here in London you would by the common ſort be cut into peeces, for they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you as a direct enemy to the Common-wealth; One that would intrench upon the liberty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo that by the authority of your tyrannicall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, all whatſoever they poſſeſſed ſhould be ſubject
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124665:5"/>unto your mercy, and upon any preſent humour, if you ſend for their goods or for money, they muſt deliver them up, and be glad to be undone, and that this could ſtand with Iuſtice was a ſtrange opinion brought up by the malignant party under whoſe colors you ſerve.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>You are deceived, my deſire is to ſave the kingdome from ruine, and preſerve the king in a free Monarchy; for the King is reſolved that he will not ſee Religion, the Baſis and foundation of a Common-wealth defaced, and that he will maintaine the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and he doth ſolely claime this power, as being the Defender of the faith; and therefore ſeeing all his actions doe reflect on the good of the Common-wealth, whereunto they ought to be directed, and while the King doth beare this reſolution all true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to ayd His Majeſty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mil.</speaker>
               <p>But if the King may force his Parliament, they may bid farwell to all Parliaments, and all their Laws wil be cut in ſunder, with the ſame ſword now drawn for the deſtruction of the Parl. therefore let the Militia and Array now agree, and ſtand for God, our <hi>K.</hi> &amp; Parl. I am not far from you under the command of the E. of Eſſex, but ſhould be glad of this reconcilement.</p>

               <speaker>Array.</speaker>
               <p>If the King were ſo pleaſed, I ſhould be glad alſo of ſuch an agreement.</p>
